    Writing this review after gifting if to my brother and using for 1 hour. Watch touch screen is awesome, no lag and smooth running. Charging is quite fast. 20 minutes and 20-60% charge. Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst.

    I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full chargeBluetooth Calling: Works far better than my expectations, the mic & speaker are good and you can talk without any background disturbance. The person on other side can also hear clear sound.Overall, this is good product in this price range. Go for it if you are looking budget friendly round dial watch.

    Touch is not much good, display size can be improvedI t's a good product in budget. Don't expect too much from this product because in this price range you will get Bluetooth calling, SPO2, SLEEP TRACKING, etc in this watch. In this price range you can go for this watch to try it. The touch is good not seeing delay when it touch and yes it's a good product not wow but yes affordable. Built quality is ok and watch strap is good. Too light you don't feel that you are wearing something in your wrist. And speaker is decent you can talk in the room but not so clear in public

    First of all design,and built quality is excellent. Beautiful watch in this price range.Sleep tracking,touch screen, Voice is clear, Mic is also good. And all other features are good.Good battery life minimum 4 to 5 days while using theatre mode or battary save mood. And Bluetooth calling mood 3 to 4 days working.Customizable watch faces are missing, No watch face storage option, always download and apply.there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. And I am not satisfied favourite contact list only 8. It will Be good if fixed through software updates. Overall very nice product value for money.

    I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be vibret .The battery life is more or less 5 to 6 days. After all these this is a good watch that's why I gave it 4 stars.

    Awesome product, does not betray at any point, also has motion sensors meaning when you move up your hand to see the time the screen automatically lights upÂ which is a really cool and amazing feature not found in other watches of this range. Watch is good as compared to money. Touch is good and according to functions value for money. Personally i found its bit heavy as compared to my another smart watch. Also using third party app for all functioning and allow permissions to access data, is not looks good interms of data security. Absolutely loved this and highly recommend this.

    I am using the watch since 2 days. I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. I am not able to add personalized wallpaper as well, I doesn't like the watch faces except a few of them. Regarding the battery life, I have changed it only once and it still has 85-90% of charge left. All the sensor seem to be working pretty good and almost accurate. There are no lagging issues. The touch response is were good. Speaker is very loud. Except the wallpapers all other features are good for this price range.

    Awesome product, does not betray at any point, also has motion sensors meaning when you move up your hand to see the time the screen automatically lights upÂ which is a really cool and amazing feature not found in other watches of this range. Watch is good as compared to money. Touch is good and according to functions value for money. Personally i found its bit heavy as compared to my another smart watch. Also using third party app for all functioning and allow permissions to access data, is not looks good interms of data security. Absolutely loved this and highly recommend this.

    I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full chargeBluetooth Calling: Works far better than my expectations, the mic & speaker are good and you can talk without any background disturbance. The person on other side can also hear clear sound.Overall, this is good product in this price range. Go for it if you are looking budget friendly round dial watch.

The touch is good not seeing delay when it touch and yes it's a good product not wow but yes affordable. Built quality is ok and watch strap is good. Too light you don't feel that you are wearing something in your wrist. And speaker is decent you can talk in the room but not so clear in public

    First of all design,and built quality is excellent. Beautiful watch in this price range.Sleep tracking,touch screen, Voice is clear, Mic is also good. And all other features are good.Good battery life minimum 4 to 5 days while using theatre mode or battary save mood. And Bluetooth calling mood 3 to 4 days working.Customizable watch faces are missing, No watch face storage option, always download and apply.there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. And I am not satisfied favourite contact list only 8. It will Be good if fixed through software updates. Overall very nice product value for money.

    I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full chargeBluetooth Calling: Works far better than my expectations, the mic & speaker are good and you can talk without any background disturbance. The person on other side can also hear clear sound.Overall, this is good product in this price range. Go for it if you are looking budget friendly round dial watch.

    I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be vibret .The battery life is more or less 5 to 6 days. After all these this is a good watch that's why I gave it 4 stars.

    Awesome product, does not betray at any point, also has motion sensors meaning when you move up your hand to see the time the screen automatically lights upÂ which is a really cool and amazing feature not found in other watches of this range. Watch is good as compared to money. Touch is good and according to functions value for money. Personally i found its bit heavy as compared to my another smart watch. Also using third party app for all functioning and allow permissions to access data, is not looks good interms of data security. Absolutely loved this and highly recommend this.

    I am using the watch since 2 days. I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. I am not able to add personalized wallpaper as well, I doesn't like the watch faces except a few of them. Regarding the battery life, I have changed it only once and it still has 85-90% of charge left. All the sensor seem to be working pretty good and almost accurate. There are no lagging issues. The touch response is were good. Speaker is very loud. Except the wallpapers all other features are good for this price range.

    Writing this review after gifting if to my brother and using for 1 hour. Watch touch screen is awesome, no lag and smooth running. Charging is quite fast. 20 minutes and 20-60% charge. Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst.

    Awesome product, does not betray at any point, also has motion sensors meaning when you move up your hand to see the time the screen automatically lights upÂ which is a really cool and amazing feature not found in other watches of this range. Watch is good as compared to money. Touch is good and according to functions value for money. Personally i found its bit heavy as compared to my another smart watch. Also using third party app for all functioning and allow permissions to access data, is not looks good interms of data security. Absolutely loved this and highly recommend this.

    I am using the watch since 2 days. I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. I am not able to add personalized wallpaper as well, I doesn't like the watch faces except a few of them. Regarding the battery life, I have changed it only once and it still has 85-90% of charge left. All the sensor seem to be working pretty good and almost accurate. There are no lagging issues. The touch response is were good. Speaker is very loud. Except the wallpapers all other features are good for this price range.

    I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full chargeBluetooth Calling: Works far better than my expectations, the mic & speaker are good and you can talk without any background disturbance. The person on other side can also hear clear sound.Overall, this is good product in this price range. Go for it if you are looking budget friendly round dial watch.

    Touch is not much good, display size can be improvedI t's a good product in budget. Don't expect too much from this product because in this price range you will get Bluetooth calling, SPO2, SLEEP TRACKING, etc in this watch. In this price range you can go for this watch to try it. The touch is good not seeing delay when it touch and yes it's a good product not wow but yes affordable. Built quality is ok and watch strap is good. Too light you don't feel that you are wearing something in your wrist. And speaker is decent you can talk in the room but not so clear in public

When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. And I am not satisfied favourite contact list only 8. It will Be good if fixed through software updates. Overall very nice product value for money.

    Writing this review after gifting if to my brother and using for 1 hour. Watch touch screen is awesome, no lag and smooth running. Charging is quite fast. 20 minutes and 20-60% charge. Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst.

Don't expect too much from this product because in this price range you will get Bluetooth calling, SPO2, SLEEP TRACKING, etc in this watch. In this price range you can go for this watch to try it. The touch is good not seeing delay when it touch and yes it's a good product not wow but yes affordable. Built quality is ok and watch strap is good. Too light you don't feel that you are wearing something in your wrist. And speaker is decent you can talk in the room but not so clear in public

    First of all design,and built quality is excellent. Beautiful watch in this price range.Sleep tracking,touch screen, Voice is clear, Mic is also good. And all other features are good.Good battery life minimum 4 to 5 days while using theatre mode or battary save mood. And Bluetooth calling mood 3 to 4 days working.Customizable watch faces are missing, No watch face storage option, always download and apply.there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. And I am not satisfied favourite contact list only 8. It will Be good if fixed through software updates. Overall very nice product value for money.

    I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be vibret .The battery life is more or less 5 to 6 days. After all these this is a good watch that's why I gave it 4 stars.

    Awesome product, does not betray at any point, also has motion sensors meaning when you move up your hand to see the time the screen automatically lights upÂ which is a really cool and amazing feature not found in other watches of this range. Watch is good as compared to money. Touch is good and according to functions value for money. Personally i found its bit heavy as compared to my another smart watch. Also using third party app for all functioning and allow permissions to access data, is not looks good interms of data security. Absolutely loved this and highly recommend this.

    I am using the watch since 2 days. I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. I am not able to add personalized wallpaper as well, I doesn't like the watch faces except a few of them. Regarding the battery life, I have changed it only once and it still has 85-90% of charge left. All the sensor seem to be working pretty good and almost accurate. There are no lagging issues. The touch response is were good. Speaker is very loud. Except the wallpapers all other features are good for this price range.

    I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full chargeBluetooth Calling: Works far better than my expectations, the mic & speaker are good and you can talk without any background disturbance. The person on other side can also hear clear sound.Overall, this is good product in this price range. Go for it if you are looking budget friendly round dial watch.

    Writing this review after gifting if to my brother and using for 1 hour. Watch touch screen is awesome, no lag and smooth running. Charging is quite fast. 20 minutes and 20-60% charge. Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst.

    I am using the watch since 2 days. I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. I am not able to add personalized wallpaper as well, I doesn't like the watch faces except a few of them. Regarding the battery life, I have changed it only once and it still has 85-90% of charge left. All the sensor seem to be working pretty good and almost accurate. There are no lagging issues. The touch response is were good. Speaker is very loud. Except the wallpapers all other features are good for this price range.

    Touch is not much good, display size can be improved it's a good product in budget. Don't expect too much from this product because in this price range you will get Bluetooth calling, SPO2, SLEEP TRACKING, etc in this watch. In this price range you can go for this watch to try it. The touch is good not seeing delay when it touch and yes it's a good product not wow but yes affordable. Built quality is ok and watch strap is good.

    Awesome product, does not betray at any point, also has motion sensors meaning when you move up your hand to see the time the screen automatically lights upÂ which is a really cool and amazing feature not found in other watches of this range. Watch is good as compared to money. Touch is good and according to functions value for money. Personally i found its bit heavy as compared to my another smart watch. Also using third party app for all functioning and allow permissions to access data, is not looks good interms of data security. Absolutely loved this and highly recommend this.

    Writing this review after gifting if to my brother and using for 1 hour. Watch touch screen is awesome, no lag and smooth running. Charging is quite fast. 20 minutes and 20-60% charge. Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst.

    I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full chargeBluetooth Calling: Works far better than my expectations, the mic & speaker are good and you can talk without any background disturbance. The person on other side can also hear clear sound.Overall, this is good product in this price range. Go for it if you are looking budget friendly round dial watch.

    First of all design,and built quality is excellent. Beautiful watch in this price range.Sleep tracking,touch screen, Voice is clear, Mic is also good. And all other features are good.Good battery life minimum 4 to 5 days while using theatre mode or battary save mood. And Bluetooth calling mood 3 to 4 days working.Customizable watch faces are missing, No watch face storage option, always download and apply.there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. And I am not satisfied favourite contact list only 8. It will Be good if fixed through software updates. Overall very nice product value for money.

    I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full chargeBluetooth Calling: Works far better than my expectations, the mic & speaker are good and you can talk without any background disturbance. The person on other side can also hear clear sound.Overall, this is good product in this price range. Go for it if you are looking budget friendly round dial watch.

    Touch is not much good, display size can be improvedI t's a good product in budget. Don't expect too much from this product because in this price range you will get Bluetooth calling, SPO2, SLEEP TRACKING, etc in this watch. In this price range you can go for this watch to try it. The touch is good not seeing delay when it touch and yes it's a good product not wow but yes affordable. Built quality is ok and watch strap is good. Too light you don't feel that you are wearing something in your wrist. And speaker is decent you can talk in the room but not so clear in public

    First of all design,and built quality is excellent. Beautiful watch in this price range.Sleep tracking,touch screen, Voice is clear, Mic is also good. And all other features are good.Good battery life minimum 4 to 5 days while using theatre mode or battary save mood. And Bluetooth calling mood 3 to 4 days working.Customizable watch faces are missing, No watch face storage option, always download and apply.there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. And I am not satisfied favourite contact list only 8. It will Be good if fixed through software updates. Overall very nice product value for money.

    Writing this review after gifting if to my brother and using for 1 hour. Watch touch screen is awesome, no lag and smooth running. Charging is quite fast. 20 minutes and 20-60% charge. Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst.

    I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be vibret .The battery life is more or less 5 to 6 days. After all these this is a good watch that's why I gave it 4 stars.

    Awesome product, does not betray at any point, also has motion sensors meaning when you move up your hand to see the time the screen automatically lights upÂ which is a really cool and amazing feature not found in other watches of this range. Watch is good as compared to money. Touch is good and according to functions value for money. Personally i found its bit heavy as compared to my another smart watch. Also using third party app for all functioning and allow permissions to access data, is not looks good interms of data security. Absolutely loved this and highly recommend this.

    I am using the watch since 2 days. I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. I am not able to add personalized wallpaper as well, I doesn't like the watch faces except a few of them. Regarding the battery life, I have changed it only once and it still has 85-90% of charge left. All the sensor seem to be working pretty good and almost accurate. There are no lagging issues. The touch response is were good. Speaker is very loud. Except the wallpapers all other features are good for this price range.

    Writing this review after gifting if to my brother and using for 1 hour. Watch touch screen is awesome, no lag and smooth running. Charging is quite fast. 20 minutes and 20-60% charge. Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst.

    I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full chargeBluetooth Calling: Works far better than my expectations, the mic & speaker are good and you can talk without any background disturbance. The person on other side can also hear clear sound.Overall, this is good product in this price range. Go for it if you are looking budget friendly round dial watch.

    Touch is not much good, display size can be improvedI t's a good product in budget. Don't expect too much from this product because in this price range you will get Bluetooth calling, SPO2, SLEEP TRACKING, etc in this watch. In this price range you can go for this watch to try it. The touch is good not seeing delay when it touch and yes it's a good product not wow but yes affordable. Built quality is ok and watch strap is good. Too light you don't feel that you are wearing something in your wrist. And speaker is decent you can talk in the room but not so clear in public

    First of all design,and built quality is excellent. Beautiful watch in this price range.Sleep tracking,touch screen, Voice is clear, Mic is also good. And all other features are good.Good battery life minimum 4 to 5 days while using theatre mode or battary save mood. And Bluetooth calling mood 3 to 4 days working.Customizable watch faces are missing, No watch face storage option, always download and apply.there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. And I am not satisfied favourite contact list only 8. It will Be good if fixed through software updates. Overall very nice product value for money.

    I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be vibret .The battery life is more or less 5 to 6 days. After all these this is a good watch that's why I gave it 4 stars.

    Awesome product, does not betray at any point, also has motion sensors meaning when you move up your hand to see the time the screen automatically lights upÂ which is a really cool and amazing feature not found in other watches of this range. Watch is good as compared to money. Touch is good and according to functions value for money. Personally i found its bit heavy as compared to my another smart watch. Also using third party app for all functioning and allow permissions to access data, is not looks good interms of data security. Absolutely loved this and highly recommend this.

    I am using the watch since 2 days. I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. I am not able to add personalized wallpaper as well, I doesn't like the watch faces except a few of them. Regarding the battery life, I have changed it only once and it still has 85-90% of charge left. All the sensor seem to be working pretty good and almost accurate. There are no lagging issues. The touch response is were good. Speaker is very loud. Except the wallpapers all other features are good for this price range.

    I am using the watch since 2 days. I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. I am not able to add personalized wallpaper as well, I doesn't like the watch faces except a few of them. Regarding the battery life, I have changed it only once and it still has 85-90% of charge left. All the sensor seem to be working pretty good and almost accurate. There are no lagging issues. The touch response is were good. Speaker is very loud. Except the wallpapers all other features are good for this price range.

    Writing this review after gifting if to my brother and using for 1 hour. Watch touch screen is awesome, no lag and smooth running. Charging is quite fast. 20 minutes and 20-60% charge. Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst.

    I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full chargeBluetooth Calling: Works far better than my expectations, the mic & speaker are good and you can talk without any background disturbance. The person on other side can also hear clear sound.Overall, this is good product in this price range. Go for it if you are looking budget friendly round dial watch.

    Touch is not much good, display size can be improvedI t's a good product in budget. Don't expect too much from this product because in this price range you will get Bluetooth calling, SPO2, SLEEP TRACKING, etc in this watch. In this price range you can go for this watch to try it. The touch is good not seeing delay when it touch and yes it's a good product not wow but yes affordable. Built quality is ok and watch strap is good. Too light you don't feel that you are wearing something in your wrist. And speaker is decent you can talk in the room but not so clear in public

    First of all design,and built quality is excellent. Beautiful watch in this price range.Sleep tracking,touch screen, Voice is clear, Mic is also good. And all other features are good.Good battery life minimum 4 to 5 days while using theatre mode or battary save mood. And Bluetooth calling mood 3 to 4 days working.Customizable watch faces are missing, No watch face storage option, always download and apply.there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. And I am not satisfied favourite contact list only 8. It will Be good if fixed through software updates. Overall very nice product value for money.

    Awesome product, does not betray at any point, also has motion sensors meaning when you move up your hand to see the time the screen automatically lights upÂ which is a really cool and amazing feature not found in other watches of this range. Watch is good as compared to money. Touch is good and according to functions value for money. Personally i found its bit heavy as compared to my another smart watch. Also using third party app for all functioning and allow permissions to access data, is not looks good interms of data security. Absolutely loved this and highly recommend this.

Too light you don't feel that you are wearing something in your wrist. And speaker is decent you can talk in the room but not so clear in public

    First of all design,and built quality is excellent. Beautiful watch in this price range.Sleep tracking,touch screen, Voice is clear, Mic is also good. And all other features are good.Good battery life minimum 4 to 5 days while using theatre mode or battary save mood. And Bluetooth calling mood 3 to 4 days working.Customizable watch faces are missing, No watch face storage option, always download and apply.there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. And I am not satisfied favourite contact list only 8. It will Be good if fixed through software updates. Overall very nice product value for money.

    I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be vibret .The battery life is more or less 5 to 6 days. After all these this is a good watch that's why I gave it 4 stars.

    Awesome product, does not betray at any point, also has motion sensors meaning when you move up your hand to see the time the screen automatically lights upÂ which is a really cool and amazing feature not found in other watches of this range. Watch is good as compared to money. Touch is good and according to functions value for money. Personally i found its bit heavy as compared to my another smart watch. Also using third party app for all functioning and allow permissions to access data, is not looks good interms of data security. Absolutely loved this and highly recommend this.

    I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full chargeBluetooth Calling: Works far better than my expectations, the mic & speaker are good and you can talk without any background disturbance. The person on other side can also hear clear sound.Overall, this is good product in this price range. Go for it if you are looking budget friendly round dial watch.

    I am using the watch since 2 days. I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. I am not able to add personalized wallpaper as well, I doesn't like the watch faces except a few of them. Regarding the battery life, I have changed it only once and it still has 85-90% of charge left. All the sensor seem to be working pretty good and almost accurate. There are no lagging issues. The touch response is were good. Speaker is very loud. Except the wallpapers all other features are good for this price range.

    Writing this review after gifting if to my brother and using for 1 hour. Watch touch screen is awesome, no lag and smooth running. Charging is quite fast. 20 minutes and 20-60% charge. Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst.

    I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be vibret .The battery life is more or less 5 to 6 days. After all these this is a good watch that's why I gave it 4 stars.

    Awesome product, does not betray at any point, also has motion sensors meaning when you move up your hand to see the time the screen automatically lights upÂ which is a really cool and amazing feature not found in other watches of this range. Watch is good as compared to money. Touch is good and according to functions value for money. Personally i found its bit heavy as compared to my another smart watch. Also using third party app for all functioning and allow permissions to access data, is not looks good interms of data security. Absolutely loved this and highly recommend this.

    I am using the watch since 2 days. I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. I am not able to add personalized wallpaper as well, I doesn't like the watch faces except a few of them. Regarding the battery life, I have changed it only once and it still has 85-90% of charge left. All the sensor seem to be working pretty good and almost accurate. There are no lagging issues. The touch response is were good. Speaker is very loud. Except the wallpapers all other features are good for this price range.

    Writing this review after gifting if to my brother and using for 1 hour. Watch touch screen is awesome, no lag and smooth running. Charging is quite fast. 20 minutes and 20-60% charge. Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst.

    I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full chargeBluetooth Calling: Works far better than my expectations, the mic & speaker are good and you can talk without any background disturbance. The person on other side can also hear clear sound.Overall, this is good product in this price range. Go for it if you are looking budget friendly round dial watch.

    Touch is not much good, display size can be improvedI t's a good product in budget. Don't expect too much from this product because in this price range you will get Bluetooth calling, SPO2, SLEEP TRACKING, etc in this watch. In this price range you can go for this watch to try it. The touch is good not seeing delay when it touch and yes it's a good product not wow but yes affordable. Built quality is ok and watch strap is good. Too light you don't feel that you are wearing something in your wrist. And speaker is decent you can talk in the room but not so clear in public

    First of all design,and built quality is excellent. Beautiful watch in this price range.Sleep tracking,touch screen, Voice is clear, Mic is also good. And all other features are good.Good battery life minimum 4 to 5 days while using theatre mode or battary save mood. And Bluetooth calling mood 3 to 4 days working.Customizable watch faces are missing, No watch face storage option, always download and apply.there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. And I am not satisfied favourite contact list only 8. It will Be good if fixed through software updates. Overall very nice product value for money.

    I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be vibret .The battery life is more or less 5 to 6 days. After all these this is a good watch that's why I gave it 4 stars.

    Writing this review after gifting if to my brother and using for 1 hour. Watch touch screen is awesome, no lag and smooth running. Charging is quite fast. 20 minutes and 20-60% charge. Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst.

    Awesome product, does not betray at any point, also has motion sensors meaning when you move up your hand to see the time the screen automatically lights upÂ which is a really cool and amazing feature not found in other watches of this range. Watch is good as compared to money. Touch is good and according to functions value for money. Personally i found its bit heavy as compared to my another smart watch. Also using third party app for all functioning and allow permissions to access data, is not looks good interms of data security. Absolutely loved this and highly recommend this.

    I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full chargeBluetooth Calling: Works far better than my expectations, the mic & speaker are good and you can talk without any background disturbance. The person on other side can also hear clear sound.Overall, this is good product in this price range. Go for it if you are looking budget friendly round dial watch.

    I am using the watch since 2 days. I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. I am not able to add personalized wallpaper as well, I doesn't like the watch faces except a few of them. Regarding the battery life, I have changed it only once and it still has 85-90% of charge left. All the sensor seem to be working pretty good and almost accurate. There are no lagging issues. The touch response is were good. Speaker is very loud. Except the wallpapers all other features are good for this price range.

    I am using the watch since 2 days. I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. I am not able to add personalized wallpaper as well, I doesn't like the watch faces except a few of them. Regarding the battery life, I have changed it only once and it still has 85-90% of charge left. All the sensor seem to be working pretty good and almost accurate. There are no lagging issues. The touch response is were good. Speaker is very loud. Except the wallpapers all other features are good for this price range.

    I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full chargeBluetooth Calling: Works far better than my expectations, the mic & speaker are good and you can talk without any background disturbance. The person on other side can also hear clear sound.Overall, this is good product in this price range. Go for it if you are looking budget friendly round dial watch.

    Touch is not much good, display size can be improvedI t's a good product in budget. Don't expect too much from this product because in this price range you will get Bluetooth calling, SPO2, SLEEP TRACKING, etc in this watch. In this price range you can go for this watch to try it. The touch is good not seeing delay when it touch and yes it's a good product not wow but yes affordable. Built quality is ok and watch strap is good. Too light you don't feel that you are wearing something in your wrist. And speaker is decent you can talk in the room but not so clear in public

    First of all design,and built quality is excellent. Beautiful watch in this price range.Sleep tracking,touch screen, Voice is clear, Mic is also good. And all other features are good.Good battery life minimum 4 to 5 days while using theatre mode or battary save mood. And Bluetooth calling mood 3 to 4 days working.Customizable watch faces are missing, No watch face storage option, always download and apply.there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. And I am not satisfied favourite contact list only 8. It will Be good if fixed through software updates. Overall very nice product value for money.

    Awesome product, does not betray at any point, also has motion sensors meaning when you move up your hand to see the time the screen automatically lights upÂ which is a really cool and amazing feature not found in other watches of this range. Watch is good as compared to money. Touch is good and according to functions value for money. Personally i found its bit heavy as compared to my another smart watch. Also using third party app for all functioning and allow permissions to access data, is not looks good interms of data security. Absolutely loved this and highly recommend this.

    Writing this review after gifting if to my brother and using for 1 hour. Watch touch screen is awesome, no lag and smooth running. Charging is quite fast. 20 minutes and 20-60% charge. Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst.

    I am using the watch since 2 days. I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. I am not able to add personalized wallpaper as well, I doesn't like the watch faces except a few of them. Regarding the battery life, I have changed it only once and it still has 85-90% of charge left. All the sensor seem to be working pretty good and almost accurate. There are no lagging issues. The touch response is were good. Speaker is very loud. Except the wallpapers all other features are good for this price range.

    I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full chargeBluetooth Calling: Works far better than my expectations, the mic & speaker are good and you can talk without any background disturbance. The person on other side can also hear clear sound.Overall, this is good product in this price range. Go for it if you are looking budget friendly round dial watch.

    Touch is not much good, display size can be improvedI t's a good product in budget. Don't expect too much from this product because in this price range you will get Bluetooth calling, SPO2, SLEEP TRACKING, etc in this watch. In this price range you can go for this watch to try it. The touch is good not seeing delay when it touch and yes it's a good product not wow but yes affordable. Built quality is ok and watch strap is good. Too light you don't feel that you are wearing something in your wrist. And speaker is decent you can talk in the room but not so clear in public

    First of all design,and built quality is excellent. Beautiful watch in this price range.Sleep tracking,touch screen, Voice is clear, Mic is also good. And all other features are good.Good battery life minimum 4 to 5 days while using theatre mode or battary save mood. And Bluetooth calling mood 3 to 4 days working.Customizable watch faces are missing, No watch face storage option, always download and apply.there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. And I am not satisfied favourite contact list only 8. It will Be good if fixed through software updates. Overall very nice product value for money.

    Awesome product, does not betray at any point, also has motion sensors meaning when you move up your hand to see the time the screen automatically lights upÂ which is a really cool and amazing feature not found in other watches of this range. Watch is good as compared to money. Touch is good and according to functions value for money. Personally i found its bit heavy as compared to my another smart watch. Also using third party app for all functioning and allow permissions to access data, is not looks good interms of data security. Absolutely loved this and highly recommend this.

    Writing this review after gifting if to my brother and using for 1 hour. Watch touch screen is awesome, no lag and smooth running. Charging is quite fast. 20 minutes and 20-60% charge. Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst.

    I am using the watch since 2 days. I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. I am not able to add personalized wallpaper as well, I doesn't like the watch faces except a few of them. Regarding the battery life, I have changed it only once and it still has 85-90% of charge left. All the sensor seem to be working pretty good and almost accurate. There are no lagging issues. The touch response is were good. Speaker is very loud. Except the wallpapers all other features are good for this price range.

    Writing this review after gifting if to my brother and using for 1 hour. Watch touch screen is awesome, no lag and smooth running. Charging is quite fast. 20 minutes and 20-60% charge. Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst.

    I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full chargeBluetooth Calling: Works far better than my expectations, the mic & speaker are good and you can talk without any background disturbance. The person on other side can also hear clear sound.Overall, this is good product in this price range. Go for it if you are looking budget friendly round dial watch.

    Touch is not much good, display size can be improvedI t's a good product in budget. Don't expect too much from this product because in this price range you will get Bluetooth calling, SPO2, SLEEP TRACKING, etc in this watch. In this price range you can go for this watch to try it. The touch is good not seeing delay when it touch and yes it's a good product not wow but yes affordable. Built quality is ok and watch strap is good. Too light you don't feel that you are wearing something in your wrist. And speaker is decent you can talk in the room but not so clear in public

    First of all design,and built quality is excellent. Beautiful watch in this price range.Sleep tracking,touch screen, Voice is clear, Mic is also good. And all other features are good.Good battery life minimum 4 to 5 days while using theatre mode or battary save mood. And Bluetooth calling mood 3 to 4 days working.Customizable watch faces are missing, No watch face storage option, always download and apply.there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. And I am not satisfied favourite contact list only 8. It will Be good if fixed through software updates. Overall very nice product value for money.

    Awesome product, does not betray at any point, also has motion sensors meaning when you move up your hand to see the time the screen automatically lights upÂ which is a really cool and amazing feature not found in other watches of this range. Watch is good as compared to money. Touch is good and according to functions value for money. Personally i found its bit heavy as compared to my another smart watch. Also using third party app for all functioning and allow permissions to access data, is not looks good interms of data security. Absolutely loved this and highly recommend this.

    I am using the watch since 2 days. I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. I am not able to add personalized wallpaper as well, I doesn't like the watch faces except a few of them. Regarding the battery life, I have changed it only once and it still has 85-90% of charge left. All the sensor seem to be working pretty good and almost accurate. There are no lagging issues. The touch response is were good. Speaker is very loud. Except the wallpapers all other features are good for this price range.

    Awesome product, does not betray at any point, also has motion sensors meaning when you move up your hand to see the time the screen automatically lights upÂ which is a really cool and amazing feature not found in other watches of this range. Watch is good as compared to money. Touch is good and according to functions value for money. Personally i found its bit heavy as compared to my another smart watch. Also using third party app for all functioning and allow permissions to access data, is not looks good interms of data security. Absolutely loved this and highly recommend this.

    I am using the watch since 2 days. I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. I am not able to add personalized wallpaper as well, I doesn't like the watch faces except a few of them. Regarding the battery life, I have changed it only once and it still has 85-90% of charge left. All the sensor seem to be working pretty good and almost accurate. There are no lagging issues. The touch response is were good. Speaker is very loud. Except the wallpapers all other features are good for this price range.

    Writing this review after gifting if to my brother and using for 1 hour. Watch touch screen is awesome, no lag and smooth running. Charging is quite fast. 20 minutes and 20-60% charge. Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst.

    I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full chargeBluetooth Calling: Works far better than my expectations, the mic & speaker are good and you can talk without any background disturbance. The person on other side can also hear clear sound.Overall, this is good product in this price range. Go for it if you are looking budget friendly round dial watch.

    Touch is not much good, display size can be improvedI t's a good product in budget. Don't expect too much from this product because in this price range you will get Bluetooth calling, SPO2, SLEEP TRACKING, etc in this watch. In this price range you can go for this watch to try it. The touch is good not seeing delay when it touch and yes it's a good product not wow but yes affordable. Built quality is ok and watch strap is good. Too light you don't feel that you are wearing something in your wrist. And speaker is decent you can talk in the room but not so clear in public

    First of all design,and built quality is excellent. Beautiful watch in this price range.Sleep tracking,touch screen, Voice is clear, Mic is also good. And all other features are good.Good battery life minimum 4 to 5 days while using theatre mode or battary save mood. And Bluetooth calling mood 3 to 4 days working.Customizable watch faces are missing, No watch face storage option, always download and apply.there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. And I am not satisfied favourite contact list only 8. It will Be good if fixed through software updates. Overall very nice product value for money.

    Awesome product, does not betray at any point, also has motion sensors meaning when you move up your hand to see the time the screen automatically lights upÂ which is a really cool and amazing feature not found in other watches of this range. Watch is good as compared to money. Touch is good and according to functions value for money. Personally i found its bit heavy as compared to my another smart watch. Also using third party app for all functioning and allow permissions to access data, is not looks good interms of data security. Absolutely loved this and highly recommend this.

    Touch is not much good, display size can be improved it's a good product in budget. Don't expect too much from this product because in this price range you will get Bluetooth calling, SPO2, SLEEP TRACKING, etc in this watch. In this price range you can go for this watch to try it. The touch is good not seeing delay when it touch and yes it's a good product not wow but yes affordable. Built quality is ok and watch strap is good.

    I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be vibret .The battery life is more or less 5 to 6 days. After all these this is a good watch that's why I gave it 4 stars.

    Awesome product, does not betray at any point, also has motion sensors meaning when you move up your hand to see the time the screen automatically lights upÂ which is a really cool and amazing feature not found in other watches of this range. Watch is good as compared to money. Touch is good and according to functions value for money. Personally i found its bit heavy as compared to my another smart watch. Also using third party app for all functioning and allow permissions to access data, is not looks good interms of data security. Absolutely loved this and highly recommend this.

    I am using the watch since 2 days. I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. I am not able to add personalized wallpaper as well, I doesn't like the watch faces except a few of them. Regarding the battery life, I have changed it only once and it still has 85-90% of charge left. All the sensor seem to be working pretty good and almost accurate. There are no lagging issues. The touch response is were good. Speaker is very loud. Except the wallpapers all other features are good for this price range.

    Writing this review after gifting if to my brother and using for 1 hour. Watch touch screen is awesome, no lag and smooth running. Charging is quite fast. 20 minutes and 20-60% charge. Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst.

    I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full chargeBluetooth Calling: Works far better than my expectations, the mic & speaker are good and you can talk without any background disturbance. The person on other side can also hear clear sound.Overall, this is good product in this price range. Go for it if you are looking budget friendly round dial watch.

    Writing this review after gifting if to my brother and using for 1 hour. Watch touch screen is awesome, no lag and smooth running. Charging is quite fast. 20 minutes and 20-60% charge. Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst.

Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full chargeBluetooth Calling: Works far better than my expectations, the mic & speaker are good and you can talk without any background disturbance. The person on other side can also hear clear sound.Overall, this is good product in this price range. Go for it if you are looking budget friendly round dial watch.

    Touch is not much good, display size can be improvedI t's a good product in budget. Don't expect too much from this product because in this price range you will get Bluetooth calling, SPO2, SLEEP TRACKING, etc in this watch. In this price range you can go for this watch to try it. The touch is good not seeing delay when it touch and yes it's a good product not wow but yes affordable. Built quality is ok and watch strap is good. Too light you don't feel that you are wearing something in your wrist. And speaker is decent you can talk in the room but not so clear in public

    First of all design,and built quality is excellent. Beautiful watch in this price range.Sleep tracking,touch screen, Voice is clear, Mic is also good. And all other features are good.Good battery life minimum 4 to 5 days while using theatre mode or battary save mood. And Bluetooth calling mood 3 to 4 days working.Customizable watch faces are missing, No watch face storage option, always download and apply.there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. And I am not satisfied favourite contact list only 8. It will Be good if fixed through software updates. Overall very nice product value for money.

    I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be vibret .The battery life is more or less 5 to 6 days. After all these this is a good watch that's why I gave it 4 stars.

    Awesome product, does not betray at any point, also has motion sensors meaning when you move up your hand to see the time the screen automatically lights upÂ which is a really cool and amazing feature not found in other watches of this range. Watch is good as compared to money. Touch is good and according to functions value for money. Personally i found its bit heavy as compared to my another smart watch. Also using third party app for all functioning and allow permissions to access data, is not looks good interms of data security. Absolutely loved this and highly recommend this.

    I am using the watch since 2 days. I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. I am not able to add personalized wallpaper as well, I doesn't like the watch faces except a few of them. Regarding the battery life, I have changed it only once and it still has 85-90% of charge left. All the sensor seem to be working pretty good and almost accurate. There are no lagging issues. The touch response is were good. Speaker is very loud. Except the wallpapers all other features are good for this price range.

    Writing this review after gifting if to my brother and using for 1 hour. Watch touch screen is awesome, no lag and smooth running. Charging is quite fast. 20 minutes and 20-60% charge. Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst.

    I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full chargeBluetooth Calling: Works far better than my expectations, the mic & speaker are good and you can talk without any background disturbance. The person on other side can also hear clear sound.Overall, this is good product in this price range. Go for it if you are looking budget friendly round dial watch.

    Touch is not much good, display size can be improvedI t's a good product in budget. Don't expect too much from this product because in this price range you will get Bluetooth calling, SPO2, SLEEP TRACKING, etc in this watch. In this price range you can go for this watch to try it. The touch is good not seeing delay when it touch and yes it's a good product not wow but yes affordable. Built quality is ok and watch strap is good. Too light you don't feel that you are wearing something in your wrist. And speaker is decent you can talk in the room but not so clear in public

    First of all design,and built quality is excellent. Beautiful watch in this price range.Sleep tracking,touch screen, Voice is clear, Mic is also good. And all other features are good.Good battery life minimum 4 to 5 days while using theatre mode or battary save mood. And Bluetooth calling mood 3 to 4 days working.Customizable watch faces are missing, No watch face storage option, always download and apply.there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. And I am not satisfied favourite contact list only 8. It will Be good if fixed through software updates. Overall very nice product value for money.

    Awesome product, does not betray at any point, also has motion sensors meaning when you move up your hand to see the time the screen automatically lights upÂ which is a really cool and amazing feature not found in other watches of this range.

    I am using the watch since 2 days. I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. I am not able to add personalized wallpaper as well, I doesn't like the watch faces except a few of them. Regarding the battery life, I have changed it only once and it still has 85-90% of charge left. All the sensor seem to be working pretty good and almost accurate. There are no lagging issues. The touch response is were good. Speaker is very loud. Except the wallpapers all other features are good for this price range.

    Writing this review after gifting if to my brother and using for 1 hour. Watch touch screen is awesome, no lag and smooth running. Charging is quite fast. 20 minutes and 20-60% charge. Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst.

    Awesome product, does not betray at any point, also has motion sensors meaning when you move up your hand to see the time the screen automatically lights upÂ which is a really cool and amazing feature not found in other watches of this range. Watch is good as compared to money. Touch is good and according to functions value for money. Personally i found its bit heavy as compared to my another smart watch. Also using third party app for all functioning and allow permissions to access data, is not looks good interms of data security. Absolutely loved this and highly recommend this.

    Writing this review after gifting if to my brother and using for 1 hour. Watch touch screen is awesome, no lag and smooth running. Charging is quite fast. 20 minutes and 20-60% charge. Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst.

    I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full chargeBluetooth Calling: Works far better than my expectations, the mic & speaker are good and you can talk without any background disturbance. The person on other side can also hear clear sound.Overall, this is good product in this price range. Go for it if you are looking budget friendly round dial watch.

    Touch is not much good, display size can be improvedI t's a good product in budget. Don't expect too much from this product because in this price range you will get Bluetooth calling, SPO2, SLEEP TRACKING, etc in this watch. In this price range you can go for this watch to try it. The touch is good not seeing delay when it touch and yes it's a good product not wow but yes affordable. Built quality is ok and watch strap is good. Too light you don't feel that you are wearing something in your wrist. And speaker is decent you can talk in the room but not so clear in public

    First of all design,and built quality is excellent. Beautiful watch in this price range.Sleep tracking,touch screen, Voice is clear, Mic is also good. And all other features are good.Good battery life minimum 4 to 5 days while using theatre mode or battary save mood. And Bluetooth calling mood 3 to 4 days working.Customizable watch faces are missing, No watch face storage option, always download and apply.there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. And I am not satisfied favourite contact list only 8. It will Be good if fixed through software updates. Overall very nice product value for money.

    I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be vibret .The battery life is more or less 5 to 6 days. After all these this is a good watch that's why I gave it 4 stars.

    Awesome product, does not betray at any point, also has motion sensors meaning when you move up your hand to see the time the screen automatically lights upÂ which is a really cool and amazing feature not found in other watches of this range. Watch is good as compared to money. Touch is good and according to functions value for money. Personally i found its bit heavy as compared to my another smart watch. Also using third party app for all functioning and allow permissions to access data, is not looks good interms of data security. Absolutely loved this and highly recommend this.

    I am using the watch since 2 days. I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. I am not able to add personalized wallpaper as well, I doesn't like the watch faces except a few of them. Regarding the battery life, I have changed it only once and it still has 85-90% of charge left. All the sensor seem to be working pretty good and almost accurate. There are no lagging issues. The touch response is were good. Speaker is very loud. Except the wallpapers all other features are good for this price range.

    I am using the watch since 2 days. I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. I am not able to add personalized wallpaper as well, I doesn't like the watch faces except a few of them. Regarding the battery life, I have changed it only once and it still has 85-90% of charge left. All the sensor seem to be working pretty good and almost accurate. There are no lagging issues. The touch response is were good. Speaker is very loud. Except the wallpapers all other features are good for this price range.

    Writing this review after gifting if to my brother and using for 1 hour. Watch touch screen is awesome, no lag and smooth running. Charging is quite fast. 20 minutes and 20-60% charge. Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst.

    I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full chargeBluetooth Calling: Works far better than my expectations, the mic & speaker are good and you can talk without any background disturbance. The person on other side can also hear clear sound.Overall, this is good product in this price range. Go for it if you are looking budget friendly round dial watch.

    Touch is not much good, display size can be improvedI t's a good product in budget. Don't expect too much from this product because in this price range you will get Bluetooth calling, SPO2, SLEEP TRACKING, etc in this watch. In this price range you can go for this watch to try it. The touch is good not seeing delay when it touch and yes it's a good product not wow but yes affordable. Built quality is ok and watch strap is good. Too light you don't feel that you are wearing something in your wrist. And speaker is decent you can talk in the room but not so clear in public

    First of all design,and built quality is excellent. Beautiful watch in this price range.Sleep tracking,touch screen, Voice is clear, Mic is also good. And all other features are good.Good battery life minimum 4 to 5 days while using theatre mode or battary save mood. And Bluetooth calling mood 3 to 4 days working.Customizable watch faces are missing, No watch face storage option, always download and apply.there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. And I am not satisfied favourite contact list only 8. It will Be good if fixed through software updates. Overall very nice product value for money.

    Awesome product, does not betray at any point, also has motion sensors meaning when you move up your hand to see the time the screen automatically lights upÂ which is a really cool and amazing feature not found in other watches of this range. Watch is good as compared to money. Touch is good and according to functions value for money. Personally i found its bit heavy as compared to my another smart watch. Also using third party app for all functioning and allow permissions to access data, is not looks good interms of data security. Absolutely loved this and highly recommend this.

    Writing this review after gifting if to my brother and using for 1 hour. Watch touch screen is awesome, no lag and smooth running. Charging is quite fast. 20 minutes and 20-60% charge. Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst.

If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst.

    I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full chargeBluetooth Calling: Works far better than my expectations, the mic & speaker are good and you can talk without any background disturbance. The person on other side can also hear clear sound.Overall, this is good product in this price range. Go for it if you are looking budget friendly round dial watch.

    Touch is not much good, display size can be improvedI t's a good product in budget. Don't expect too much from this product because in this price range you will get Bluetooth calling, SPO2, SLEEP TRACKING, etc in this watch. In this price range you can go for this watch to try it. The touch is good not seeing delay when it touch and yes it's a good product not wow but yes affordable. Built quality is ok and watch strap is good. Too light you don't feel that you are wearing something in your wrist. And speaker is decent you can talk in the room but not so clear in public

    First of all design,and built quality is excellent. Beautiful watch in this price range.Sleep tracking,touch screen, Voice is clear, Mic is also good. And all other features are good.Good battery life minimum 4 to 5 days while using theatre mode or battary save mood. And Bluetooth calling mood 3 to 4 days working.Customizable watch faces are missing, No watch face storage option, always download and apply.there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. And I am not satisfied favourite contact list only 8. It will Be good if fixed through software updates. Overall very nice product value for money.

    I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be vibret .The battery life is more or less 5 to 6 days. After all these this is a good watch that's why I gave it 4 stars.

    Awesome product, does not betray at any point, also has motion sensors meaning when you move up your hand to see the time the screen automatically lights upÂ which is a really cool and amazing feature not found in other watches of this range. Watch is good as compared to money. Touch is good and according to functions value for money. Personally i found its bit heavy as compared to my another smart watch. Also using third party app for all functioning and allow permissions to access data, is not looks good interms of data security. Absolutely loved this and highly recommend this.

    I am using the watch since 2 days. I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. I am not able to add personalized wallpaper as well, I doesn't like the watch faces except a few of them. Regarding the battery life, I have changed it only once and it still has 85-90% of charge left. All the sensor seem to be working pretty good and almost accurate. There are no lagging issues. The touch response is were good. Speaker is very loud. Except the wallpapers all other features are good for this price range.

    Writing this review after gifting if to my brother and using for 1 hour. Watch touch screen is awesome, no lag and smooth running. Charging is quite fast. 20 minutes and 20-60% charge. Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm.

    I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be vibret .The battery life is more or less 5 to 6 days. After all these this is a good watch that's why I gave it 4 stars.

    Awesome product, does not betray at any point, also has motion sensors meaning when you move up your hand to see the time the screen automatically lights upÂ which is a really cool and amazing feature not found in other watches of this range. Watch is good as compared to money. Touch is good and according to functions value for money. Personally i found its bit heavy as compared to my another smart watch. Also using third party app for all functioning and allow permissions to access data, is not looks good interms of data security. Absolutely loved this and highly recommend this.

    I am using the watch since 2 days. I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. I am not able to add personalized wallpaper as well, I doesn't like the watch faces except a few of them. Regarding the battery life, I have changed it only once and it still has 85-90% of charge left. All the sensor seem to be working pretty good and almost accurate. There are no lagging issues. The touch response is were good. Speaker is very loud. Except the wallpapers all other features are good for this price range.

    Writing this review after gifting if to my brother and using for 1 hour. Watch touch screen is awesome, no lag and smooth running. Charging is quite fast. 20 minutes and 20-60% charge. Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst.

    I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full chargeBluetooth Calling: Works far better than my expectations, the mic & speaker are good and you can talk without any background disturbance. The person on other side can also hear clear sound.Overall, this is good product in this price range. Go for it if you are looking budget friendly round dial watch.

    First of all design,and built quality is excellent. Beautiful watch in this price range.Sleep tracking,touch screen, Voice is clear, Mic is also good. And all other features are good.Good battery life minimum 4 to 5 days while using theatre mode or battary save mood. And Bluetooth calling mood 3 to 4 days working.Customizable watch faces are missing, No watch face storage option, always download and apply.there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. And I am not satisfied favourite contact list only 8. It will Be good if fixed through software updates. Overall very nice product value for money.

    I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full chargeBluetooth Calling: Works far better than my expectations, the mic & speaker are good and you can talk without any background disturbance. The person on other side can also hear clear sound.Overall, this is good product in this price range. Go for it if you are looking budget friendly round dial watch.

    Touch is not much good, display size can be improvedI t's a good product in budget. Don't expect too much from this product because in this price range you will get Bluetooth calling, SPO2, SLEEP TRACKING, etc in this watch. In this price range you can go for this watch to try it. The touch is good not seeing delay when it touch and yes it's a good product not wow but yes affordable. Built quality is ok and watch strap is good. Too light you don't feel that you are wearing something in your wrist. And speaker is decent you can talk in the room but not so clear in public

    First of all design,and built quality is excellent. Beautiful watch in this price range.Sleep tracking,touch screen, Voice is clear, Mic is also good. And all other features are good.Good battery life minimum 4 to 5 days while using theatre mode or battary save mood. And Bluetooth calling mood 3 to 4 days working.Customizable watch faces are missing, No watch face storage option, always download and apply.there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. And I am not satisfied favourite contact list only 8. It will Be good if fixed through software updates. Overall very nice product value for money.

    I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be vibret .The battery life is more or less 5 to 6 days. After all these this is a good watch that's why I gave it 4 stars.

    Awesome product, does not betray at any point, also has motion sensors meaning when you move up your hand to see the time the screen automatically lights upÂ which is a really cool and amazing feature not found in other watches of this range. Watch is good as compared to money. Touch is good and according to functions value for money. Personally i found its bit heavy as compared to my another smart watch. Also using third party app for all functioning and allow permissions to access data, is not looks good interms of data security. Absolutely loved this and highly recommend this.

    I am using the watch since 2 days. I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. I am not able to add personalized wallpaper as well, I doesn't like the watch faces except a few of them. Regarding the battery life, I have changed it only once and it still has 85-90% of charge left. All the sensor seem to be working pretty good and almost accurate. There are no lagging issues. The touch response is were good. Speaker is very loud. Except the wallpapers all other features are good for this price range.

    Writing this review after gifting if to my brother and using for 1 hour. Watch touch screen is awesome, no lag and smooth running. Charging is quite fast. 20 minutes and 20-60% charge. Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst.

    I am using the watch since 2 days. I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. I am not able to add personalized wallpaper as well, I doesn't like the watch faces except a few of them. Regarding the battery life, I have changed it only once and it still has 85-90% of charge left. All the sensor seem to be working pretty good and almost accurate. There are no lagging issues. The touch response is were good. Speaker is very loud. Except the wallpapers all other features are good for this price range.

    I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full chargeBluetooth Calling: Works far better than my expectations, the mic & speaker are good and you can talk without any background disturbance. The person on other side can also hear clear sound.Overall, this is good product in this price range. Go for it if you are looking budget friendly round dial watch.

    Touch is not much good, display size can be improvedI t's a good product in budget. Don't expect too much from this product because in this price range you will get Bluetooth calling, SPO2, SLEEP TRACKING, etc in this watch. In this price range you can go for this watch to try it. The touch is good not seeing delay when it touch and yes it's a good product not wow but yes affordable. Built quality is ok and watch strap is good. Too light you don't feel that you are wearing something in your wrist. And speaker is decent you can talk in the room but not so clear in public

    First of all design,and built quality is excellent. Beautiful watch in this price range.Sleep tracking,touch screen, Voice is clear, Mic is also good. And all other features are good.Good battery life minimum 4 to 5 days while using theatre mode or battary save mood. And Bluetooth calling mood 3 to 4 days working.Customizable watch faces are missing, No watch face storage option, always download and apply.there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. And I am not satisfied favourite contact list only 8. It will Be good if fixed through software updates. Overall very nice product value for money.

    Awesome product, does not betray at any point, also has motion sensors meaning when you move up your hand to see the time the screen automatically lights upÂ which is a really cool and amazing feature not found in other watches of this range. Watch is good as compared to money. Touch is good and according to functions value for money. Personally i found its bit heavy as compared to my another smart watch. Also using third party app for all functioning and allow permissions to access data, is not looks good interms of data security. Absolutely loved this and highly recommend this.

    Writing this review after gifting if to my brother and using for 1 hour. Watch touch screen is awesome, no lag and smooth running. Charging is quite fast. 20 minutes and 20-60% charge. Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst.

The touch response is were good. Speaker is very loud. Except the wallpapers all other features are good for this price range.

    Writing this review after gifting if to my brother and using for 1 hour. Watch touch screen is awesome, no lag and smooth running. Charging is quite fast. 20 minutes and 20-60% charge. Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst.

    I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full chargeBluetooth Calling: Works far better than my expectations, the mic & speaker are good and you can talk without any background disturbance. The person on other side can also hear clear sound.Overall, this is good product in this price range. Go for it if you are looking budget friendly round dial watch.

    Touch is not much good, display size can be improvedI t's a good product in budget. Don't expect too much from this product because in this price range you will get Bluetooth calling, SPO2, SLEEP TRACKING, etc in this watch. In this price range you can go for this watch to try it. The touch is good not seeing delay when it touch and yes it's a good product not wow but yes affordable. Built quality is ok and watch strap is good. Too light you don't feel that you are wearing something in your wrist. And speaker is decent you can talk in the room but not so clear in public

    First of all design,and built quality is excellent. Beautiful watch in this price range.Sleep tracking,touch screen, Voice is clear, Mic is also good. And all other features are good.Good battery life minimum 4 to 5 days while using theatre mode or battary save mood. And Bluetooth calling mood 3 to 4 days working.Customizable watch faces are missing, No watch face storage option, always download and apply.there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. And I am not satisfied favourite contact list only 8. It will Be good if fixed through software updates. Overall very nice product value for money.

    Awesome product, does not betray at any point, also has motion sensors meaning when you move up your hand to see the time the screen automatically lights upÂ which is a really cool and amazing feature not found in other watches of this range. Watch is good as compared to money. Touch is good and according to functions value for money. Personally i found its bit heavy as compared to my another smart watch. Also using third party app for all functioning and allow permissions to access data, is not looks good interms of data security. Absolutely loved this and highly recommend this.

    Awesome product, does not betray at any point, also has motion sensors meaning when you move up your hand to see the time the screen automatically lights upÂ which is a really cool and amazing feature not found in other watches of this range. Watch is good as compared to money. Touch is good and according to functions value for money. Personally i found its bit heavy as compared to my another smart watch. Also using third party app for all functioning and allow permissions to access data, is not looks good interms of data security. Absolutely loved this and highly recommend this.

    I am using the watch since 2 days. I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. I am not able to add personalized wallpaper as well, I doesn't like the watch faces except a few of them. Regarding the battery life, I have changed it only once and it still has 85-90% of charge left. All the sensor seem to be working pretty good and almost accurate. There are no lagging issues. The touch response is were good. Speaker is very loud. Except the wallpapers all other features are good for this price range.

    Writing this review after gifting if to my brother and using for 1 hour. Watch touch screen is awesome, no lag and smooth running. Charging is quite fast. 20 minutes and 20-60% charge. Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst.

    I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full chargeBluetooth Calling: Works far better than my expectations, the mic & speaker are good and you can talk without any background disturbance. The person on other side can also hear clear sound.Overall, this is good product in this price range. Go for it if you are looking budget friendly round dial watch.

    Touch is not much good, display size can be improvedI t's a good product in budget. Don't expect too much from this product because in this price range you will get Bluetooth calling, SPO2, SLEEP TRACKING, etc in this watch. In this price range you can go for this watch to try it. The touch is good not seeing delay when it touch and yes it's a good product not wow but yes affordable. Built quality is ok and watch strap is good. Too light you don't feel that you are wearing something in your wrist. And speaker is decent you can talk in the room but not so clear in public

    First of all design,and built quality is excellent. Beautiful watch in this price range.Sleep tracking,touch screen, Voice is clear, Mic is also good. And all other features are good.Good battery life minimum 4 to 5 days while using theatre mode or battary save mood. And Bluetooth calling mood 3 to 4 days working.Customizable watch faces are missing, No watch face storage option, always download and apply.there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. And I am not satisfied favourite contact list only 8. It will Be good if fixed through software updates. Overall very nice product value for money.

When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be vibret .The battery life is more or less 5 to 6 days. After all these this is a good watch that's why I gave it 4 stars.

    Awesome product, does not betray at any point, also has motion sensors meaning when you move up your hand to see the time the screen automatically lights upÂ which is a really cool and amazing feature not found in other watches of this range. Watch is good as compared to money. Touch is good and according to functions value for money. Personally i found its bit heavy as compared to my another smart watch. Also using third party app for all functioning and allow permissions to access data, is not looks good interms of data security. Absolutely loved this and highly recommend this.

    I am using the watch since 2 days. I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. I am not able to add personalized wallpaper as well, I doesn't like the watch faces except a few of them. Regarding the battery life, I have changed it only once and it still has 85-90% of charge left. All the sensor seem to be working pretty good and almost accurate. There are no lagging issues. The touch response is were good. Speaker is very loud. Except the wallpapers all other features are good for this price range.

    Touch is not much good, display size can be improvedI t's a good product in budget. Don't expect too much from this product because in this price range you will get Bluetooth calling, SPO2, SLEEP TRACKING, etc in this watch. In this price range you can go for this watch to try it. The touch is good not seeing delay when it touch and yes it's a good product not wow but yes affordable. Built quality is ok and watch strap is good. Too light you don't feel that you are wearing something in your wrist. And speaker is decent you can talk in the room but not so clear in public

    First of all design,and built quality is excellent. Beautiful watch in this price range.Sleep tracking,touch screen, Voice is clear, Mic is also good. And all other features are good.Good battery life minimum 4 to 5 days while using theatre mode or battary save mood. And Bluetooth calling mood 3 to 4 days working.Customizable watch faces are missing, No watch face storage option, always download and apply.there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. And I am not satisfied favourite contact list only 8. It will Be good if fixed through software updates. Overall very nice product value for money.

    Writing this review after gifting if to my brother and using for 1 hour. Watch touch screen is awesome, no lag and smooth running. Charging is quite fast. 20 minutes and 20-60% charge. Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst.

    I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full chargeBluetooth Calling: Works far better than my expectations, the mic & speaker are good and you can talk without any background disturbance. The person on other side can also hear clear sound.Overall, this is good product in this price range. Go for it if you are looking budget friendly round dial watch.

The person on other side can also hear clear sound.Overall, this is good product in this price range. Go for it if you are looking budget friendly round dial watch.

    Touch is not much good, display size can be improvedI t's a good product in budget. Don't expect too much from this product because in this price range you will get Bluetooth calling, SPO2, SLEEP TRACKING, etc in this watch. In this price range you can go for this watch to try it. The touch is good not seeing delay when it touch and yes it's a good product not wow but yes affordable. Built quality is ok and watch strap is good. Too light you don't feel that you are wearing something in your wrist. And speaker is decent you can talk in the room but not so clear in public

    First of all design,and built quality is excellent. Beautiful watch in this price range.Sleep tracking,touch screen, Voice is clear, Mic is also good. And all other features are good.Good battery life minimum 4 to 5 days while using theatre mode or battary save mood. And Bluetooth calling mood 3 to 4 days working.Customizable watch faces are missing, No watch face storage option, always download and apply.there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. And I am not satisfied favourite contact list only 8. It will Be good if fixed through software updates. Overall very nice product value for money.

    I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be vibret .The battery life is more or less 5 to 6 days. After all these this is a good watch that's why I gave it 4 stars.

    Awesome product, does not betray at any point, also has motion sensors meaning when you move up your hand to see the time the screen automatically lights upÂ which is a really cool and amazing feature not found in other watches of this range. Watch is good as compared to money. Touch is good and according to functions value for money. Personally i found its bit heavy as compared to my another smart watch. Also using third party app for all functioning and allow permissions to access data, is not looks good interms of data security. Absolutely loved this and highly recommend this.

    I am using the watch since 2 days. I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. I am not able to add personalized wallpaper as well, I doesn't like the watch faces except a few of them. Regarding the battery life, I have changed it only once and it still has 85-90% of charge left. All the sensor seem to be working pretty good and almost accurate. There are no lagging issues. The touch response is were good. Speaker is very loud. Except the wallpapers all other features are good for this price range.

    I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately.

    Writing this review after gifting if to my brother and using for 1 hour. Watch touch screen is awesome, no lag and smooth running. Charging is quite fast. 20 minutes and 20-60% charge. Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst.

    I am using the watch since 2 days. I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. I am not able to add personalized wallpaper as well, I doesn't like the watch faces except a few of them. Regarding the battery life, I have changed it only once and it still has 85-90% of charge left. All the sensor seem to be working pretty good and almost accurate. There are no lagging issues. The touch response is were good. Speaker is very loud. Except the wallpapers all other features are good for this price range.

    Writing this review after gifting if to my brother and using for 1 hour. Watch touch screen is awesome, no lag and smooth running. Charging is quite fast. 20 minutes and 20-60% charge. Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst.

    Touch is not much good, display size can be improvedI t's a good product in budget. Don't expect too much from this product because in this price range you will get Bluetooth calling, SPO2, SLEEP TRACKING, etc in this watch. In this price range you can go for this watch to try it. The touch is good not seeing delay when it touch and yes it's a good product not wow but yes affordable. Built quality is ok and watch strap is good. Too light you don't feel that you are wearing something in your wrist. And speaker is decent you can talk in the room but not so clear in public

    First of all design,and built quality is excellent. Beautiful watch in this price range.Sleep tracking,touch screen, Voice is clear, Mic is also good. And all other features are good.Good battery life minimum 4 to 5 days while using theatre mode or battary save mood. And Bluetooth calling mood 3 to 4 days working.Customizable watch faces are missing, No watch face storage option, always download and apply.there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. And I am not satisfied favourite contact list only 8. It will Be good if fixed through software updates. Overall very nice product value for money.

    I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full chargeBluetooth Calling: Works far better than my expectations, the mic & speaker are good and you can talk without any background disturbance. The person on other side can also hear clear sound.Overall, this is good product in this price range. Go for it if you are looking budget friendly round dial watch.

    Awesome product, does not betray at any point, also has motion sensors meaning when you move up your hand to see the time the screen automatically lights upÂ which is a really cool and amazing feature not found in other watches of this range. Watch is good as compared to money. Touch is good and according to functions value for money. Personally i found its bit heavy as compared to my another smart watch. Also using third party app for all functioning and allow permissions to access data, is not looks good interms of data security. Absolutely loved this and highly recommend this.

Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst.

    I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full chargeBluetooth Calling: Works far better than my expectations, the mic & speaker are good and you can talk without any background disturbance. The person on other side can also hear clear sound.Overall, this is good product in this price range. Go for it if you are looking budget friendly round dial watch.

    Touch is not much good, display size can be improvedI t's a good product in budget. Don't expect too much from this product because in this price range you will get Bluetooth calling, SPO2, SLEEP TRACKING, etc in this watch. In this price range you can go for this watch to try it. The touch is good not seeing delay when it touch and yes it's a good product not wow but yes affordable. Built quality is ok and watch strap is good. Too light you don't feel that you are wearing something in your wrist. And speaker is decent you can talk in the room but not so clear in public

    First of all design,and built quality is excellent. Beautiful watch in this price range.Sleep tracking,touch screen, Voice is clear, Mic is also good. And all other features are good.Good battery life minimum 4 to 5 days while using theatre mode or battary save mood. And Bluetooth calling mood 3 to 4 days working.Customizable watch faces are missing, No watch face storage option, always download and apply.there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. And I am not satisfied favourite contact list only 8. It will Be good if fixed through software updates. Overall very nice product value for money.

    I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be vibret .The battery life is more or less 5 to 6 days. After all these this is a good watch that's why I gave it 4 stars.

    Awesome product, does not betray at any point, also has motion sensors meaning when you move up your hand to see the time the screen automatically lights upÂ which is a really cool and amazing feature not found in other watches of this range. Watch is good as compared to money. Touch is good and according to functions value for money. Personally i found its bit heavy as compared to my another smart watch. Also using third party app for all functioning and allow permissions to access data, is not looks good interms of data security. Absolutely loved this and highly recommend this.

    I am using the watch since 2 days. I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. I am not able to add personalized wallpaper as well, I doesn't like the watch faces except a few of them. Regarding the battery life, I have changed it only once and it still has 85-90% of charge left. All the sensor seem to be working pretty good and almost accurate. There are no lagging issues. The touch response is were good. Speaker is very loud. Except the wallpapers all other features are good for this price range.

    Writing this review after gifting if to my brother and using for 1 hour. Watch touch screen is awesome, no lag and smooth running. Charging is quite fast. 20 minutes and 20-60% charge. Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst.

    I am using the watch since 2 days. I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. I am not able to add personalized wallpaper as well, I doesn't like the watch faces except a few of them. Regarding the battery life, I have changed it only once and it still has 85-90% of charge left. All the sensor seem to be working pretty good and almost accurate. There are no lagging issues. The touch response is were good. Speaker is very loud. Except the wallpapers all other features are good for this price range.

    I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full chargeBluetooth Calling: Works far better than my expectations, the mic & speaker are good and you can talk without any background disturbance. The person on other side can also hear clear sound.Overall, this is good product in this price range. Go for it if you are looking budget friendly round dial watch.

    Touch is not much good, display size can be improvedI t's a good product in budget. Don't expect too much from this product because in this price range you will get Bluetooth calling, SPO2, SLEEP TRACKING, etc in this watch. In this price range you can go for this watch to try it. The touch is good not seeing delay when it touch and yes it's a good product not wow but yes affordable. Built quality is ok and watch strap is good. Too light you don't feel that you are wearing something in your wrist. And speaker is decent you can talk in the room but not so clear in public

    First of all design,and built quality is excellent. Beautiful watch in this price range.Sleep tracking,touch screen, Voice is clear, Mic is also good. And all other features are good.Good battery life minimum 4 to 5 days while using theatre mode or battary save mood. And Bluetooth calling mood 3 to 4 days working.Customizable watch faces are missing, No watch face storage option, always download and apply.there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. And I am not satisfied favourite contact list only 8. It will Be good if fixed through software updates. Overall very nice product value for money.

    Awesome product, does not betray at any point, also has motion sensors meaning when you move up your hand to see the time the screen automatically lights upÂ which is a really cool and amazing feature not found in other watches of this range. Watch is good as compared to money. Touch is good and according to functions value for money. Personally i found its bit heavy as compared to my another smart watch. Also using third party app for all functioning and allow permissions to access data, is not looks good interms of data security. Absolutely loved this and highly recommend this.

    I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be vibret .The battery life is more or less 5 to 6 days. After all these this is a good watch that's why I gave it 4 stars.

    Awesome product, does not betray at any point, also has motion sensors meaning when you move up your hand to see the time the screen automatically lights upÂ which is a really cool and amazing feature not found in other watches of this range. Watch is good as compared to money. Touch is good and according to functions value for money. Personally i found its bit heavy as compared to my another smart watch. Also using third party app for all functioning and allow permissions to access data, is not looks good interms of data security. Absolutely loved this and highly recommend this.

    I am using the watch since 2 days. I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. I am not able to add personalized wallpaper as well, I doesn't like the watch faces except a few of them. Regarding the battery life, I have changed it only once and it still has 85-90% of charge left. All the sensor seem to be working pretty good and almost accurate. There are no lagging issues. The touch response is were good. Speaker is very loud. Except the wallpapers all other features are good for this price range.

    Writing this review after gifting if to my brother and using for 1 hour. Watch touch screen is awesome, no lag and smooth running. Charging is quite fast. 20 minutes and 20-60% charge. Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst.

    I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full chargeBluetooth Calling: Works far better than my expectations, the mic & speaker are good and you can talk without any background disturbance. The person on other side can also hear clear sound.Overall, this is good product in this price range. Go for it if you are looking budget friendly round dial watch.

    Touch is not much good, display size can be improvedI t's a good product in budget. Don't expect too much from this product because in this price range you will get Bluetooth calling, SPO2, SLEEP TRACKING, etc in this watch. In this price range you can go for this watch to try it. The touch is good not seeing delay when it touch and yes it's a good product not wow but yes affordable. Built quality is ok and watch strap is good. Too light you don't feel that you are wearing something in your wrist. And speaker is decent you can talk in the room but not so clear in public

    First of all design,and built quality is excellent. Beautiful watch in this price range.Sleep tracking,touch screen, Voice is clear, Mic is also good. And all other features are good.Good battery life minimum 4 to 5 days while using theatre mode or battary save mood. And Bluetooth calling mood 3 to 4 days working.Customizable watch faces are missing, No watch face storage option, always download and apply.there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. And I am not satisfied favourite contact list only 8. It will Be good if fixed through software updates. Overall very nice product value for money.

    Touch is not much good, display size can be improved it's a good product in budget. Don't expect too much from this product because in this price range you will get Bluetooth calling, SPO2, SLEEP TRACKING, etc in this watch. In this price range you can go for this watch to try it. The touch is good not seeing delay when it touch and yes it's a good product not wow but yes affordable. Built quality is ok and watch strap is good.

    I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be vibret .The battery life is more or less 5 to 6 days. After all these this is a good watch that's why I gave it 4 stars.

    Awesome product, does not betray at any point, also has motion sensors meaning when you move up your hand to see the time the screen automatically lights upÂ which is a really cool and amazing feature not found in other watches of this range. Watch is good as compared to money. Touch is good and according to functions value for money. Personally i found its bit heavy as compared to my another smart watch. Also using third party app for all functioning and allow permissions to access data, is not looks good interms of data security. Absolutely loved this and highly recommend this.

    I am using the watch since 2 days. I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. I am not able to add personalized wallpaper as well, I doesn't like the watch faces except a few of them. Regarding the battery life, I have changed it only once and it still has 85-90% of charge left. All the sensor seem to be working pretty good and almost accurate. There are no lagging issues. The touch response is were good. Speaker is very loud. Except the wallpapers all other features are good for this price range.

    Writing this review after gifting if to my brother and using for 1 hour. Watch touch screen is awesome, no lag and smooth running. Charging is quite fast. 20 minutes and 20-60% charge. Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst.

    I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full chargeBluetooth Calling: Works far better than my expectations, the mic & speaker are good and you can talk without any background disturbance. The person on other side can also hear clear sound.Overall, this is good product in this price range. Go for it if you are looking budget friendly round dial watch.

Don't expect too much from this product because in this price range you will get Bluetooth calling, SPO2, SLEEP TRACKING, etc in this watch. In this price range you can go for this watch to try it. The touch is good not seeing delay when it touch and yes it's a good product not wow but yes affordable. Built quality is ok and watch strap is good. Too light you don't feel that you are wearing something in your wrist. And speaker is decent you can talk in the room but not so clear in public

    Writing this review after gifting if to my brother and using for 1 hour. Watch touch screen is awesome, no lag and smooth running. Charging is quite fast. 20 minutes and 20-60% charge. Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst.

    First of all design,and built quality is excellent. Beautiful watch in this price range.Sleep tracking,touch screen, Voice is clear, Mic is also good. And all other features are good.Good battery life minimum 4 to 5 days while using theatre mode or battary save mood. And Bluetooth calling mood 3 to 4 days working.Customizable watch faces are missing, No watch face storage option, always download and apply.there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. And I am not satisfied favourite contact list only 8. It will Be good if fixed through software updates. Overall very nice product value for money.

    I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be vibret .The battery life is more or less 5 to 6 days. After all these this is a good watch that's why I gave it 4 stars.

    I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full chargeBluetooth Calling: Works far better than my expectations, the mic & speaker are good and you can talk without any background disturbance. The person on other side can also hear clear sound.Overall, this is good product in this price range. Go for it if you are looking budget friendly round dial watch.

    Awesome product, does not betray at any point, also has motion sensors meaning when you move up your hand to see the time the screen automatically lights upÂ which is a really cool and amazing feature not found in other watches of this range. Watch is good as compared to money. Touch is good and according to functions value for money. Personally i found its bit heavy as compared to my another smart watch. Also using third party app for all functioning and allow permissions to access data, is not looks good interms of data security. Absolutely loved this and highly recommend this.

    I am using the watch since 2 days. I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. I am not able to add personalized wallpaper as well, I doesn't like the watch faces except a few of them. Regarding the battery life, I have changed it only once and it still has 85-90% of charge left. All the sensor seem to be working pretty good and almost accurate. There are no lagging issues. The touch response is were good. Speaker is very loud. Except the wallpapers all other features are good for this price range.

Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst.

    I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full chargeBluetooth Calling: Works far better than my expectations, the mic & speaker are good and you can talk without any background disturbance. The person on other side can also hear clear sound.Overall, this is good product in this price range. Go for it if you are looking budget friendly round dial watch.

    Touch is not much good, display size can be improvedI t's a good product in budget. Don't expect too much from this product because in this price range you will get Bluetooth calling, SPO2, SLEEP TRACKING, etc in this watch. In this price range you can go for this watch to try it. The touch is good not seeing delay when it touch and yes it's a good product not wow but yes affordable. Built quality is ok and watch strap is good. Too light you don't feel that you are wearing something in your wrist. And speaker is decent you can talk in the room but not so clear in public

    First of all design,and built quality is excellent. Beautiful watch in this price range.Sleep tracking,touch screen, Voice is clear, Mic is also good. And all other features are good.Good battery life minimum 4 to 5 days while using theatre mode or battary save mood. And Bluetooth calling mood 3 to 4 days working.Customizable watch faces are missing, No watch face storage option, always download and apply.there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. And I am not satisfied favourite contact list only 8. It will Be good if fixed through software updates. Overall very nice product value for money.

    I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be vibret .The battery life is more or less 5 to 6 days. After all these this is a good watch that's why I gave it 4 stars.

    Awesome product, does not betray at any point, also has motion sensors meaning when you move up your hand to see the time the screen automatically lights upÂ which is a really cool and amazing feature not found in other watches of this range. Watch is good as compared to money. Touch is good and according to functions value for money. Personally i found its bit heavy as compared to my another smart watch. Also using third party app for all functioning and allow permissions to access data, is not looks good interms of data security. Absolutely loved this and highly recommend this.

    I am using the watch since 2 days. I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. I am not able to add personalized wallpaper as well, I doesn't like the watch faces except a few of them. Regarding the battery life, I have changed it only once and it still has 85-90% of charge left. All the sensor seem to be working pretty good and almost accurate. There are no lagging issues. The touch response is were good. Speaker is very loud. Except the wallpapers all other features are good for this price range.
